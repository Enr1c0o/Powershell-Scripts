# Powershell-Scripts

These Powershell Scripts are made to ease Screensharing, and are made by myself.
Make sure to run all the scripts as admin as some of the scripts require admin perms to be able to do thier work.
also some of the scripts may not work if its in .ps1 file so run them in regular admin powershell
